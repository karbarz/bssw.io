The Supercomputing conference series is one of the premier venues for high-performance computing and computational science and engineering.  Here's a list of events that relate to producing better scientific software.  Please join us there!

**Description:** The SC20 program pages, linked from the event title in the table below, provide details including exact time and place, abstracts, etc.  Note that Supercomputing has several different registration categories, and some of the events listed require particular categories of registration. **Of particular interest: the *free* Exhibits (XO) registration category will allow access to the BOFs, as well as other significant conference activitities, such as the keynote, invited talks and posters.**
