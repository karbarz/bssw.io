There are three types of authored content on BSSw.io. See a very short description below: 

## Original article

Short article with original content. We welcome both experience articles (to inform the CSE community about how to improve some aspect of software productivity and sustainability) and blog articles. Brevity is appreciated; for example a blog is usually around 500--1,500 words. We will solicit contributions from thought leaders in the community and welcome proposals from anyone.

## Curated content 

Brief article that highlights other web-based content (such as tools, websites, books, organizations, etc.). Your article should describe why the CSE community might find value in the linked content.


## Events

Brief description of an event (such as a workshop, conference, or tutorial) relevant to better scientific software.
