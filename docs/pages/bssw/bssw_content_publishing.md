{% include note.html content="This section needs to bee completed
and verified. Should we name this content pre-publishing guidelines
and also included metadata information? Think about how this can
be organzied better especially after the styling section has been completed." %}

## What is this document?
This is a work-in-progress review checklist for all content that goes on the BSSw site. Content is of three major types on BSSw: (1) Events, (2) Curated Content and (3) Original Articles (including short articles and blogs). We discuss the review checklist for these three types of content.

## Who should use it and when?
To be used by the EB member in charge of the content under consideration.
When should one use it?
This document is to be used when we are ready with the content and need a final review of the document before publishing it. The BSSw.io Content Board Review serves as a step-by-step guide and can be found at: [https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/projects/3](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/projects/3). Please note that the content board has various phases, as mentioned below, but this document is intended for the **topic review** and **item review** phases. 
* Ideas backlog
* **Topic review** 
* Ready to write
* Item progress
* **Item review**
* Ready to publish
* Done

## What are the Expected Checks to be done?
 These checks are common to all types of content. 

### Topic Review Checks
* Evaluate whether the content of a contribution (i.e., PR) is appropriate for publication on BSSw.io or whether revisions are needed. 
* Is the proposed content in scope for BSSw?
* Would the proposed content "fit" with with existing content? (e.g.,  should it be a revision to or merger with an existing article rather than a separate article?)

### Item Review Checks
The following steps assume that the BSSw editorial team has already determined that the topic is appropriate scope for BSSw.io.
#### General guidance
* Confirm that the article is written as per the predetermined scope outlined during the “topic review” phase, or determine suggested revisions/clarifications
* Gender neutrality - BSSw.io articles prefer to be gender neutral 
* Article tone - BSSw.io articles prefer to be polite and not offend any sensibilities of our intended audience 
* Review for sensitive information 
* PI approval  - If an original article talks about anything that can be construed as sensitive information, it may need PI approval
* Decide whether additional professional proofreading is needed

#### Style/ formatting
* Adheres to the style guide for the specific content
* Logo/image formatting - Please check for this unless style guide has specific instructions
* Correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, syntax

#### Validity
* Check for any prior versions of the same content. 
   * If the prior version is very outdated, consider replacing it with this newer content. Please judge on a case-by-case basis. 
   * Past events of the same conferences/workshops/etc. are not deleted and just kept as archives.
* Check references
* Valid hyperlinks
* Image copyright permissions 
* Licensing terms checked  - BSSw.io eventually needs a box that should say "By checking this box, author acknowledges and agrees to licensing terms of content they develop here" 

#### Metadata 
* Finalize the category(ies) and topic(s) 
* Sanity check on preview site for overall display
