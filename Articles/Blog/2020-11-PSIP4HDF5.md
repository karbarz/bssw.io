# Recent Successes with PSIP on HDF5

## Introduction
[Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP)](https://bssw-psip.github.io/)
is Agile for software *process* (as opposed to *product*) improvements. Quoting from
a [November 2019 workshop paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-44728-1_6)
describing PSIP…

> PSIP breaks from classic software process improvement approaches such as CMM(I), SPICE, ISO
> 9000 or Six Sigma, in that it trades comprehensive standards and certification-driven assessment
> for self-defined, internally driven goals. It does, however, carry forward such ideas as having
> staged models of improvement (like CMM(I)) in the form of progress tracking cards. PSIP is more
> aligned with agile methods; it adopts their emphasis on iterative improvement and continuous
> learning.

PSIP helps already overburdened teams define and carry out a series of small, incremental steps of
progression towards process improvement goals without significant (there will be some, but a key goal
of PSIP is to avoid *significant*) disruption to ongoing development activities. A key enabling tool
in PSIP is the use of
[Progress Tracking Cards](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/PSIP-Tools/PTCs/) (PTCs) which
define the steps of progression towards a given improvement goal.

In April of 2020, the
[LLNL WSC](https://wci.llnl.gov/about-us/weapon-simulation-and-computing) Research Coordination Council
established a $150K contract with [The HDF Group](https://www.hdfgroup.org)
(THG), the organization responsible for developing and maintaining
[HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/HDF5), to employ PSIP to effect some
software process improvement goals (IGs).

[HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/HDF5) was selected as a use case for evaluating PSIP
because [NNSA](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/national-nuclear-security-administration) labs are working
to broaden HDF5's adoption as a community code. We also expect any process improvements realized will
benefit many DOE HPC/CSE applications that depend on HDF5. In its 20+ year history the development team
has practiced various software process improvement methodologies making the team an invaluable resource
in offering a comparative perspective on PSIP.

The following timeline of work was followed...

Activity | Lead by... | Completion date
:---|:---|:---
Kickoff training/meeting | PSIP Team | April 22, 2020
Candidate IGs & Down-select|PSIP Team/LLNL/THG| May 6, 2020
Draft & Finalize PTCs |PSIP Team/LLNL/THG| May 15, 2020
Execute on PTCs/progress updates | THG | Bi-weekly through Sept 15, 2020
Retrospective & Report outcomes| THG/LLNL | Sept 30, 2020

Work kicked off with a two-hour training where PSIP facilitators lead THG staff, comprised of a mix
of developers, testers, customer support reps, and product managers, through two
exercises. This whole-workforce engagement approach is crucial to enabling a project to identify
overall productivity “pain points”. Guiding principles of PSIP, that the process is non-judgmental,
bottom-up and consensus-driven with input from all stakeholders, are critical to success in gathering
input from all staff regarding factors impacting productivity.

In the first exercise, each THG staff member independently did a
[self-survey](https://bssw-psip.github.io/ptc-catalog/survey.html)
of HDF5 software processes. This was followed by a group discussion to compare perceptions and help
the team identify common pain points ripe for process improvement. In the second exercise, the team
practiced creating a progress tracking card (PTC) for a mutually agreed upon example improvement goal,
first individually and then as a group followed by group dialog.

From an initial list of 13 candidate IGs THG staff brainstormed, three were selected to carry forward
and create PTCs

1. Improvement Goal #1 (IG1): Modernize processes for handling various forms of documentation
1. Improvement Goal #2 (IG2): Move HDF5 from a THG managed Bitbucket instance to GitHub
1. Improvement Goal #3 (IG3): Define and adopt a set of consistent coding standards

THG staff members then self-organized around the IG(s) they were passionate about drafting and refining an
associated PTC. Developing quality PTCs, is essential but also non-trivial.
It can require facilitation by an experienced but objective third party. The challenge is in ensuring
that each step has a good definition of done and also represents a value-added improvement in
existing processes. This ensures that if progression through PTC steps ever stalls, the effort
expended to reach that point is not at risk of being orphaned or lost.

For THG staff, shifting from thinking about *product* (e.g. delivering on promised features) to thinking
about *process* was, at first, challenging. Time pressures of development have been such that rarely has
this team had an opportunity to think holistically about process improvement. It took a while for THG
staff members to put on this new thinking cap. This is likely true of many HPC/CSE development teams.
Treating process improvements as *deliverables* is key to winning a team's commitment to their
completion.

## Outcomes and Overall Assessment
PSIP with HDF5 has been a phenomenal success! Substantial progress was made on all three IGs. The
progress achieved exceeded expectations. The completion of IG1 using a combination of
[Doxygen](https://hdf5.io/develop/index.html) and [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)
represents a true shift in THG culture to treating [docs like code](https://www.docslikecode.com). The
migration of the [HDF5 library to GitHub](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5) was completed in the
first week of October, 2020 and there have already been several community contributed pull requests
submitted. The coding standards goal (IG3) had been attempted multiple times previously but success had
eluded this team for several years.

Three sub-teams of between 7 and 14 THG staff members consumed a cumulative of only 1/2 FTE of effort to
effect these critical process improvements. Subsequent productivity boosts due to improved processes are
likely to recapture this cost in the first year, if not sooner.

Project leadership and front line developers at THG expect to continuing using PSIP for future process
improvements. THG plans to use PTCs to engage with and manage community contributions impacting
process improvements such as a recently planned effort for incrementally integrating multi-threading
support throughout the library.

### Comparison with Other Methodologies
PSIP was found to be significantly more light weight than other approaches such as
[CMM(I)](https://cmmiinstitute.com) or [PMBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge).
But that doesn’t necessarily imply that PSIP is only for lightweight tasks. PSIP avoids a lot of
front loaded, preparatory work such as cost estimating,
[WBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure), and project planning. In those other
methodologies, a lot of that preparatory work is done by PMs or PIs and the team is just given their
assignments. In PSIP, all stakeholders are engaged from the beginning and the whole process of
planning an execution feels more democratized.

PSIP also relieves team members of the baggage of having to learn a lot of special verbiage or
terminology. Top-down process improvement models such as CMM(I) can often
begin with too much abstraction making them disconnected from the sometimes unique, concrete
software development tasks any specific project demands. This gives some contributors opportunities
to hide behind or become overly distracted by these abstractions. The simplicity of PSIP is that it
gives people an opportunity to propose and advocate for specific, concrete process improvements.

PSIP is more hands-on and practical and less abstract than these other methodologies. There are
more opportunities to demonstrate progress which engenders a feeling of having completed various steps.
its software in general). Team members were motivated at the opportunity to learn and apply new technologies
or share their knowledge. Better team chemistry and engagement in process improvement was observed
throughout PSIP activities.

### Impact of funding earmarked for process improvement

Typically HPC/CSE code teams are expected to work process improvements into their existing plans
and funding streams. While it is rare to secure funding primarily for process improvement as was
the case here, it would be a mistake to infer that additional funding is the sole reason or even
a majority reason for any progress and successes attributable to PSIP.

For THG staff, being asked to improve their processes as a *deliverable* for a sponsor was not
something with which they had much experience, especially when the specific improvements and how
to go about enacting them were to be determined primarily by the team and not the sponsor.

All stakeholders agree that while additional funding certainly did help, it helped primarily from
the perspective of creating a formal contractual obligation to deliver on something, in this case
process improvements. For even smallish HPC/CSE code teams of 2-4 FTEs, the $150K here likely
represents a small fraction of their whole effort. Furthermore, the effort to implement a PSIP
is likely quickly offset by the gains in productivity resulting from improved processes.
